About Us
========

We are a team of students at Iowa State University and working on a documentation website in contribution towards the ARA project. Our project provides the resources and educational advancement for mainly undergraduate students looking to be more involved with networking, or more specifically, targeted for those interested in being actively involved with the wireless living lab for smart and connected rural communities (ARA). ARA is a project that aims to provide an affordable, high-capacity rural 5G broadband solution. Our main objective is to provide a supporting role in developing ARA team members by introducing an educational/documentation website to target audiences such as undergraduates who may be inexperienced with the concept of 5G networking. The project will then stem from targeting Iowa State-affiliated students to the general public who may be interested in not only 5G networking but also being introduced to the ARA project.

Our team is made up of students from various backgrounds, including Software engineers and Electrical Engineers.
