Other Equipment Used to Deploy 5G Networks
=================================

Abstract
---------
In addition to the basic core components of a 5G network, such as the previously mentioned RAN and core network, other noteworthy technologies and equipment are used to supplement and support the 5G network. These can affect the users directly by increasing the coverage area or upgrading the existing network infrastructure. 

Technologies and Equipment Used to Support 5G Networks
------------------------------------------------------

Other technologies that support 5G networks include network function virtualization (NFV), which allows network functions such as routing, switching, load balancing, etc., to be virtualized and run on top of a shared physical network infrastructure rather than specialized hardware. This results in decreased costs and an easier time managing the network. Another technology employed to support 5G networks include edge computing. Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the users rather than requiring all the data to flow to the centralized centers. This allows the processing and storage of data closer to the edge of the network, reducing latency and improving overall network performance. This can be useful for applications that require real-time data processing, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and industrial automation. 

<br />In addition to these technologies, several types of equipment are also used to support the 5G network. For rural or poor coverage areas, deploying small cells, which are low-powered cellular base stations, may benefit users as these small cells are used to offload traffic from the macro cellular network.  In the case of urban areas or areas with poor signal quality, distributed antenna systems or DAS may be utilized to improve signal quality as the signal from the network is distributed through a network of small antennas located throughout the coverage area rather than relying on a singular, centralized antenna.

5G RAN Overview
-----------------

Base stations make up a large part of the radio access network (RAN) and play an essential role in communication. They are responsible for many tasks, including transmitting and receiving signals with user equipment. Base stations are also in charge of managing resources; this can include managing bandwidth, power, and time slots in accordance with user equipment. It also performs scheduling and interference management to ensure that users get the best possible connection. Base stations are also in charge of signal processing. This means that signals sent from the UE to the stations are decoded to ensure they are in a form suitable for information processing. Likewise, they are also responsible for encoding signals before transmitting them to UE. This adds a measure of security when transmitting data using 5G.

Radio Technologies Utilized for 5G RAN
----------------------------------------

One of the technologies implemented in 5G technology is the use of millimeter waves. These waves are used to provide a high-speed, low latency connection especially when in urban areas where a high number of users are present. These signals donâ€™t come without their limitations however. One limitation is the limited range that comes with these signals, meaning they are easily blocked by buildings and trees. These signals also have limited penetration, meaning on top of their limited range they also have hard time penetrating solid objects. This limits the use of this type of signal indoors. These signals are also susceptible to weather, such as rain, fog, and snow.
One of the ways to overcome this range of limitations is to use beamforming technology (previously mentioned under the 5G User Equipment module), which directs the signals to the UE. Beam
