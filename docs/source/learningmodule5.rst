Other Equipment Used to Deploy 5G Networks
===========================================

Abstract
---------
In addition to the basic core components of a 5G network, such as the previously mentioned RAN and core network, other noteworthy technologies and equipment are used to supplement and support the 5G network. These can affect the users directly by increasing the coverage area or upgrading the existing network infrastructure. 

Technologies and Equipment Used to Support 5G Networks
------------------------------------------------------

Other technologies that support 5G networks include network function virtualization (NFV), which allows network functions such as routing, switching, load balancing, etc., to be virtualized and run on top of a shared physical network infrastructure rather than specialized hardware. This results in decreased costs and an easier time managing the network. Another technology employed to support 5G networks include edge computing. Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the users rather than requiring all the data to flow to the centralized centers. This allows the processing and storage of data closer to the edge of the network, reducing latency and improving overall network performance. This can be useful for applications that require real-time data processing, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and industrial automation.

In addition to these technologies, several types of equipment are also used to support the 5G network. For rural or poor coverage areas, deploying small cells, which are low-powered cellular base stations, may benefit users as these small cells are used to offload traffic from the macro cellular network.  In the case of urban areas or areas with poor signal quality, distributed antenna systems or DAS may be utilized to improve signal quality as the signal from the network is distributed through a network of small antennas located throughout the coverage area rather than relying on a singular, centralized antenna.

  Much more other technology and equipment are used to support 5G networks in order to improve the system and network infrastructure. Some of these have been around since previous network generations, and some of which are cutting edge and are only applicable to current generation networks. They all still serve the primary purpose of delivering a better user experience through increased speeds and better coverage, allowing for more global connectivity.
