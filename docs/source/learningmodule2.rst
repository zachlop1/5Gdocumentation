User Equipment
==============

Abstract
--------
While user equipment (UEs) are an important component of the architecture of a network, it can be summed up as a term used to describe devices that connect to a network or a device used by a user to communicate within a network, in our case, a 5G network. These familiar devices can be used to access the internet and communicate with other devices, such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc. UEs under the 5G umbrella typically employ advanced technologies to improve user experience by implementing methods to increase speeds, network capacity and decreased latency.

Key Features of 5G User Equipment
---------------------------------
Within a 5G setting, UEs are designed to work with various frequency bands and employ varied technologies to communicate with the network allowing for a more improved user experience. As such, this 5G multi-band support enables UEs to connect to the network in various frequency bands, including both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Access to these frequency bands allows the UEs to take advantage of the different characteristics of each frequency band which may allow for improvements in coverage and higher data rates. As a result of the increased access to various frequency bands, 5G UEs are often deployed with multiple antennas and employ advanced signal processing methods, which can improve signal quality, increase data speeds, and extend network coverage.

Some advanced antenna technologies commonly used in 5G UEs include:
- Beamforming.
- Massive MIMO.
- Full-Dimension MIMO.

Some advanced signal-processing methods commonly used in 5G UEs include:
- Channel Coding.
- Error Correction.
- Modulation.

5G UEs are designed to provide end users with a reliable, faster, and more responsive wireless experience compared to the previous generation and their predecessors.

Instances and Applications of 5G User Equipment
-----------------------------------------------
When comparing user equipment designed around 5G to the previous generations, such as 4G, it’s quite clear that 5G user equipment has the edge according to some of the following factors:
- Speed: User equipment and devices can likely reach a transfer speed of up to 20GB per second compared to 4G’s peak of 1GB per second.
- Latency: The response time or latency rate of 5G averages one millisecond. Compared to the previous generation, an average of 200 milliseconds.
- Capacity: 5G user equipment is designed to handle much more data that can be transmitted over a network. With the number of smart devices linked to homes, it may be a wiser choice to use 5G over 4G.
