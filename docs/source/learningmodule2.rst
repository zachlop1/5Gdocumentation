User Equipment
==============

Abstract
--------
While user equipment (UEs) are an important component of the architecture of a network, it can be summed up as a term used to describe devices that connect to a network or a device used by a user to communicate within a network, in our case, a 5G network. These familiar devices can be used to access the internet and communicate with other devices, such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc. UEs under the 5G umbrella typically employ advanced technologies to improve user experience by implementing methods to increase speeds, network capacity and decreased latency.

Key Features of 5G User Equipment
---------------------------------
Within a 5G setting, UEs are designed to work with various frequency bands and employ varied technologies to communicate with the network allowing for a more improved user experience. As such, this 5G multi-band support enables UEs to connect to the network in various frequency bands, including both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Access to these frequency bands allows the UEs to take advantage of the different characteristics of each frequency band which may allow for improvements in coverage and higher data rates. As a result of the increased access to various frequency bands, 5G UEs are often deployed with multiple antennas and employ advanced signal processing methods, which can improve signal quality, increase data speeds, and extend network coverage.

Some advanced antenna technologies commonly used in 5G UEs include:
- Beamforming.
- Massive MIMO.
- Full-Dimension MIMO.

Some advanced signal-processing methods commonly used in 5G UEs include:
- Channel Coding.
- Error Correction.
- Modulation.

5G UEs are designed to provide end users with a reliable, faster, and more responsive wireless experience compared to the previous generation and their predecessors.


Radio Access Network
--------------------
The radio access network, or RAN, is the component that links the user equipment to the core network (a component that is mentioned below). It consists of a network of base stations, or radio access nodes, communicating with the aforementioned user equipment using radio frequencies. UE’s can be provided wireless connectivity by transmitting and receiving radio signals through the radio access network. Some of the functions performed by the RAN include radio transmission and reception, signal processing, resource management, and security. Refer to page: “Radio Access Network” for more information



Core Network
-------------
The core network or mobile core is a critical component of a 5G network in the sense that this component is responsible for connecting the radio access networks to other external networks, such as the internet, and provides connectivity between different RAN nodes. The core network is also responsible for providing services such as authentication, routing of user traffic, and authorization.
