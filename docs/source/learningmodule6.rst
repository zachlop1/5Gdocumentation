5G Networking in Rural Locations
=================================

Abstract
---------
5G Networking is a newer technology that is hard to establish in rural areas. The infrastructure required to support this technology is not feasible for these low-cost rural areas. This coincides with the low population density in these areas - there isn’t much of a point in building 5G technologies in an area that doesn’t have enough people to justify its deployment. Another challenge for these rural areas is the obstacles to transmitting 5G signals. 5G technology utilizes millimeter waves (Discussed in “Radio Technologies Utilized for 5G RAN” module). This means that in these rural areas, the signals will also have a tough time traveling far or transmitting through obstacles - certainly another problem in rural areas.

Coverage and Infrastructure
---------------------------

5G coverage in rural areas is typically limited. In cases where the technology is found in rural areas, it is usually next to major highways or town centers. This limited coverage is partly due to the infrastructure it requires to establish this service. According to some studies, establishing 5G technologies in a small town can cost anywhere from $10 million to $30 million. This cost is usually paid for by service providers that look to make money back from customers in the area, but one of the challenges of deployment in rural areas is the lack of population. 

As stated above, small cells can increase coverage in rural areas where traditional macrocellular networks may not be practical or cost-effective. Even with the available technology of small cells, deploying such cells may still be impractical for rural areas due to other factors regarding limited power, rugged terrain, and even lower population density. Other technologies, such as satellite communications, may be more cost-effective. 

This may pose a problem for farming communities as some agriculture equipment, such as tractors and harvesters, may require or benefit from the high-speed network that comes from 5G. Having the necessary infrastructure to support such devices may still be a challenge. This cost-effectiveness and challenge of establishing infrastructure for 5G is a core factor in the slower deployment of 5G in rural areas and communities.

Economic Impact
---------------

If 5G technology is accessible in rural areas or communities, it could bring significant economic benefits to the region. For instance, implementing advanced 5G-powered vehicles in agriculture could result in more efficient farming practices, increased food exports, and other related economic gains. 5G technology also allows students in rural areas to have a much more stable learning environment through remote learning. 

Companies typically establish 5G technologies to make money back through their customers. In areas where 5G technologies have deployed, an increase in productivity and connectivity usually follows, which boosts economic growth in the area. New businesses can also arrive once 5G technology is available in rural areas, boosting economic growth.
