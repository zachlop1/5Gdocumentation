Starting your learning
======================

This section will teach you *how* to navigate our website and how you can get started with learning 5G and its relevant counterparts

Learning Modules
----------------
Under *Learning Modules*, you will find valuable information regarding 5G infrastructure. Each learning module is intended to teach you a different aspect of 5G. We suggest you go in order, as the information and quizzes we provide after each module require previous module knowledge. You will learn about: 

* Overall Basic 5G Network Structure
* User Equipment
* Technical Details of RAN Systems
* NG-Core Overview
* Other Equipment Used to Deploy 5G Networks
* 5G Networking in Rural Locations
* 5G RRC Layer
* MAC, RLC, and PDCP Layers
* 5G Physical Layer

Experiments
-----------
After reading through, and learning about 5G networking, we have provided simple experiments to test your knowledge. You will find multiple hands-on tutorials walking you through various 5G and ARA testbeds. Although it is important to be familiar with 5G networking at a textual level, it is more important to understand how it works in the real world. Under *Experiments* tab, you can find tutorials on how to run your own experiments. We provide the following testbeds:
